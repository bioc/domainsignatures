  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High-throughput technologies like functional
	screens and gene expression analysis produce extended lists of candidate
	genes. Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis is a commonly used and well established
	technique to test for the statistically significant over-representation
	of particular pathways. A shortcoming of this method is however,
	that most genes that are investigated in the experiments have very
	sparse functional or pathway annotation and therefore cannot be the
	target of such an analysis. The approach presented here aims to assign
	lists of genes with limited annotation to previously described functional
	gene collections or pathways. This works by comparing InterPro domain
	signatures of the candidate gene lists with domain signatures of
	gene sets derived from known classifications, e.g. KEGG pathways.
	RESULTS: In order to validate our approach, we designed a simulation
	study. Based on all pathways available in the KEGG database, we create
	test gene lists by randomly selecting pathway genes, removing these
	genes from the known pathways and adding variable amounts of noise
	in the form of genes not annotated to the pathway. We show that we
	can recover pathway memberships based on the simulated gene lists
	with high accuracy. We further demonstrate the applicability of our
	approach on a biological example. CONCLUSIONS: Results based on simulation
	and data analysis show that domain based pathway enrichment analysis
	is a very sensitive method to test for enrichment of pathways in
	sparsely annotated lists of genes. An R based software package domainsignatures,
	to routinely perform this analysis on the results of high-throughput
	screening, is available via Bioconductor.},
